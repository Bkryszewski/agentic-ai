# Core Capabilities

Agentic AI is designed around **capabilities**, not autonomous outcomes.

The system emphasizes control, observability, and human authority over execution.

---

## Agentic Orchestration

- Sequential and conditional agent execution
- Explicit prompt and step orchestration
- Deterministic workflow control over probabilistic outputs

---

## Decision Gates

- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- Policy-based approval and escalation paths
- Prevention of silent agent drift

---

## Contextual Intelligence (RAG)

- Structured document and data ingestion
- Multi-source context assembly
- Provenance-aware grounding

---

## Review & Explainability

- Reviewer agents for validation
- Evidence-linked outputs
- Traceable reasoning paths

---

## Integration & Extensibility

- API-first design
- Pluggable agent patterns
- Designed for staged handoffs to specialized systems
