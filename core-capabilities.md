# Core Capabilities

Agentic AI is built around **capability pillars**, not autonomous outcomes.

Each capability is designed to support controlled execution, observability, and human authority.

---

## Ingestion & Data Foundations

- Multi-channel ingestion (email, portals, APIs)
- Structured document intake and classification
- Conversion of unstructured content into usable data assets
- Separation of original assets, metadata, and embeddings

---

## Specialized Agents (Not Generic Assistants)

Agentic AI employs **specialized agents**, each with a clearly defined responsibility.

Examples include:
- Operational agents (intake, validation, routing)
- Reasoning and analysis agents
- Governance and audit agents
- Data and knowledge agents

This separation of concerns prevents agent overload and improves reliability.

---

## Agent Runtime

- Purpose-built execution environments for agents
- Isolation of agent responsibilities
- Deterministic execution boundaries
- Support for parallel and sequential processing

---

## Orchestration

- Flow-based coordination of agents
- Intent-based task routing
- Parallel execution where appropriate
- State-aware workflow progression

The orchestrator governs *how* and *when* agents act.

---

## Governance & Observability

- Runtime policy enforcement
- Confidence scoring and decision thresholds
- Full traceability across agent actions
- Evidence-linked outputs

Governance is enforced **during execution**, not after the fact.

---

## Extensibility

- API-first design
- Pluggable agent patterns
- Integration with enterprise platforms and services
- Support for staged handoffs to specialized systems
