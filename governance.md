# Governance

Governance in Agentic AI is **embedded into execution**, not layered on afterward.

---

## Why Prompt-Based GenAI Fails in Regulated Workflows

- Single-shot prompts lack state and context
- Post-generation human review creates bottlenecks
- Black-box outputs lack evidence lineage
- Policy-only controls are reactive, not preventative

---

## Embedded Governance Model

Agentic AI enforces governance through:

- Runtime policy interception
- Confidence scoring and thresholds
- Mandatory review gates
- Evidence validation before output

---

## Evidence-Based Reasoning

The system refuses to act when:
- Source evidence is missing
- Lineage cannot be established
- Outputs cannot be traced to inputs

---

## Audit & Traceability

- Every decision is logged
- Agent actions are recorded
- Human approvals are captured
- Outputs are linked to source evidence

Governance is continuous, not episodic.
