# Operating Model

Agentic AI is designed to operate within existing enterprise delivery, compliance, and governance models.

It augments human teams rather than replacing decision ownership.

---

## Human-in-the-Loop by Design

- Review roles are explicit
- Decision checkpoints are enforced
- Escalation paths are predefined
- Humans retain final authority

---

## Structural Oversight

Workflows include **review gates** that can lock execution when:

- Confidence falls below a threshold
- Required evidence is missing
- Policy constraints are violated

---

## Progressive Autonomy

- Begin with assistive execution
- Expand to semi-autonomous workflows
- Preserve checkpoints at risk boundaries
- Increase automation only when defensible

---

## Platform Deployment Model

Agentic AI is deployed as a **platform asset**, not a disposable experiment.

Typical progression:
1. Platform stand-up
2. Agent tuning
3. Pilot and user acceptance
4. Production deployment

---

## Accountability

- Clear ownership of decisions
- Separation of execution and approval
- Audit-ready operational posture
